## Overview <a name = "Overview"></a>
The User Dashboard application is an Angular-based web application that displays user information and allows for searching and viewing user details. The application utilizes Angular Material for UI components and includes features like pagination, search functionality, and user detail view. Caching mechanisms are implemented to optimize performance by reducing redundant HTTP requests.
